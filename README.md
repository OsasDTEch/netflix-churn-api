# 🚨 Exit Alert — Customer Churn Prediction App

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-Click%20Here-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://exit-alert.onrender.com)

## 🔍 Overview

**Exit Alert** is a machine learning web application that predicts whether a customer is likely to **leave** (churn) or **stay** with a business based on historical data.

This project demonstrates how **data-driven insights** can empower businesses to reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The model takes in key customer attributes and returns a prediction:

* ✅ **Will Stay**
* ❌ **Will Leave**

It’s powered by a trained binary classification algorithm built with real-world churn data.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Scikit-learn** — Machine learning and model training
* **Pandas** & **NumPy** — Data preprocessing and manipulation
* **Joblib** — Model serialization for fast deployment
